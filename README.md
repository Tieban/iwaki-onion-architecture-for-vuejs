# Screenshot - webapp case
Enriching implementations by allowing program boundaries by architecture.

Vue, located in the presentation layer, can focus solely on the duties of expressing.

# Screenshot - electron case
electron is very simple. Almost all creation is completed just by adding the electron-builder module

Most of the content implemented with "onion architecture" is the same. The only difference is whether the app has become a webapp or a desktop app.

# Screenshot - native case
Native apps have some difficulties, but everything can be programmed with javascript. This is amazing.

Vue version of react native with expo. Base built using vue-native. Further expansion to "TypeScript".
